# Adobe Obfuscate Chrome Extension

A basic chrome extension which injects CSS into various Adobe tools to obfuscate :see_no_evil: customer specific information.

This is useful for demoing of tools, or otherwise taking screenshots of pages that you want to hide some of the customer information from.

## Installation

Download the [obfuscate-adobe.zip file](https://github.com/jasonfordAdobe/obfuscate-chrome-extension/releases), and use [Load Unpacked](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) within Chrome to load the plugin.

## What you get

## How is this made

This project is made using the setup provided by [abstractalgo/react-browser-extension](https://github.com/abstractalgo/react-browser-extension)

And makes use of:
